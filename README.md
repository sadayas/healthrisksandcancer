## Presentation:
* Selected topic:
   * Which people are at risk for having a stroke?
* Reason why the topic was selected:
    * Strokes are one of the top leading causes of death in the world. Even if someone does not die from a stroke, it can leave the patient with long lasting effects that greatly impact the quality of their life. If there are simple lifestyle changes people can make to decrease their risk of having a stroke, it is worth the sacrifices to prevent this life altering ailment.  
* Description of data source:
    * The dataset is from kaggle, posted by user fedesoriano.
* Questions the dataset hopes to answer:
    * Which demographic group is most at risk for a stroke?
    * With the dataset, the hope is to predict which individuals will be more at risk to have a stroke based on their age, gender, work type, marital status, residence type, average glucose levels, bmi, smoking status, and blood pressure. 
    * Being knowledgable about the at-risk populations can help implement programs to focus on these groups. If enough prediction and research is done, it is the hope for public health initiatives to gain funding to support the prevention of strokes.
