## General:
### Communication Protocols:
Slack messenger was used to keep each other updated on parts of the project that have been completed and committed.

## Presentation:
* Selected topic:
[POSSIBLE USA ONLY DATA]
    * Prediction of which demographic group is most at risk for death by suicide.    
* Reason why the topic was selected:
    * With awareness in the mental illness epidemic rising, it is important to research all aspects of mental illnesses. Specifically, death by suicide will be the area in which we are exploring. Learning more about patterns in certain populations across the globe can help put public health initiatives in place to prevent such a rise in numbers.
* Description of data source:
    * The dataset is from World Health Organization (WHO). It outlines the country, year, sex, age range, number of people who have died by suicide and the population of the country at the time of recording.
* Questions the dataset hopes to answer:
    * Which demographic group is most at risk for death by suicide?
    * With the dataset, the hope is to predict which individuals will be more at risk to die by suicide based on their demographic group: age, sex, and country of residence. 
    * Being knowledgable about the at-risk populations can help implement programs to focus on these groups. If enough prediction and research is done, it is the hope for public health initiatives to gain funding to support the prevention of suicide and suicide attempts.
