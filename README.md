# Which health factors increase the risk for having a stroke?

## General:
### Communication Protocols:
Slack messenger, discord channel between Steven and Vienna, and Zoom were used to keep each other updated on parts of the project that have been completed and committed.

## Presentation:
* Selected topic:
   * Which health or demographic factors increase the risk for having a stroke?
* Reason why the topic was selected:
    * Strokes are one of the top leading causes of death in the world. Even if someone does not die from a stroke, it can leave the patient with long lasting effects that greatly impact the quality of their life. If there are simple lifestyle changes people can make to decrease their risk of having a stroke, it is worth the sacrifices to prevent this life altering ailment.  
* Description of data source:
    * The dataset is from kaggle, posted by user fedesoriano.
* Questions the dataset hopes to answer:
    * Which health factors increase the risk for having a stroke?
      * Hypertension? Age? BMI? 
    * Which demographic group is most at risk for a stroke?
    * With the dataset, the hope is to predict which individuals will be more at risk to have a stroke based on their age, gender, work type, marital status, residence type, average glucose levels, bmi, smoking status, and blood pressure. 
    * Being knowledgable about the at-risk populations can help implement tests and health coaching programs to focus on these groups. If enough research is done, it is the hope for health care practicioners to gain insight as to which tests should be given to prevent strokes.
